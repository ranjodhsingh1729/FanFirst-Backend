**A fan-first concert ticketing platform**  
_Developed by:_ Ranjodh Singh, Naman Singh, Nikhil Kumar


## 🚨 Problem Statement

The current ticketing ecosystem is broken. Bots and scalpers dominate sales, leaving true fans behind.

- Tickets for popular artists are sold out within minutes due to scalping.
- Genuine fans often miss the chance to experience their favorite artists live.
- Scalpers inflate resale prices, making concerts unaffordable.
- Existing systems reward speed, not loyalty.

## ✅ Proposed Solution

**Fan-Prioritized Ticketing:**  
A system that integrates with streaming services (Spotify, Apple Music) to assess fan engagement and reserve a portion of tickets exclusively for loyal listeners. This dual sales model supports both priority and general ticket allocation, reducing scalper advantages.

- **Engagement-Based Ranking:** Verifies and ranks users using streaming data.
- **Reserved Ticket Pool:** Guarantees a set number of tickets for top fans.
- **Scalper & Bot Prevention:** Implements strict account linking limits and verification.
